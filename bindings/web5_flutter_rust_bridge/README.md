# web5_flutter_rust_bridge

Flutter bindings for the Web5 Rust library.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Updating Bindings
You can update the `rust` directory and run `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate --watch`. `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` should take care of the rest.
