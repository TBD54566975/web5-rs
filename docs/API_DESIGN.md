# Key Material

> [!NOTE]
> Public & private *key material* are currently strictly represented as [Jwk](#jwk-object-oriented-class), but as the requirement for additional representations (ex: CBOR) present themselves, key material will need to be disintermediated via a polymorphic base class such as `PublicKeyMaterial` (which would expose an instance method for `get_verifier_bytes()`) and `PrivateKeyMaterial` (which would expose instance methods for `to_public_key_material()` and `get_signer_bytes()`), both of which would implement `as_jwk()`, `as_cbor()` and any other concrete representations as instance methods.

## `Jwk`

```pseudocode!
/// Partial representation of a [JSON Web Key as per RFC7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).
/// Note that this is a subset of the spec.
CLASS Jwk
  /// Identifies the algorithm intended for use with the key.
  PUBLIC DATA alg: string

  /// Represents the key type. e.g. EC for elliptic curve, OKP for Edwards curve
  PUBLIC DATA kty: string

  /// curve name for Elliptic Curve (EC) and Edwards Curve (Ed) keys.
  /// e.g. secp256k1, Ed25519
  PUBLIC DATA crv: string

  /// X coordinate for EC keys, or the public key for OKP.
  PUBLIC DATA x: string

  /// Y coordinate for EC keys.
  PUBLIC DATA y: string?

  /// Private key component for EC or OKP keys.
  PUBLIC DATA d: string?
```

## `InMemoryKeyManager`

```pseudocode!
/// An encapsulation of key material stored in-memory.
CLASS InMemoryKeyManager
  /// Generates new key material and returns the public key represented as a Jwk.
  METHOD generate_key_material(): Jwk

  /// Returns the Ed25519Signer for the given public key.
  METHOD get_signer(public_key: Jwk): Ed25519Signer

  /// For importing keys which may be stored somewhere such as environment variables.
  METHOD import_key(private_key: Jwk)
```

# Digital Signature Algorithm's (DSA)

## `Dsa`

```pseudocode!
/// The set of Digital Signature Algorithm's natively supported within this SDK.
ENUM Dsa
  Ed25519
```

> We must add support for `Xd25519`, `secp256k1`, and `secp256r1` for [full did:dht conformance](https://did-dht.com/registry/index.html#key-type-index).

## `Signer`

```pseudocode!
/// Set of functionality required to implement to be a compatible DSA signer.
INTERFACE Signer
  /// Signs the given payload by using the encapsulated private key material.
  METHOD sign(payload: []byte): []byte
```

## `Verifier`

```pseudocode!
/// Set of functionality required to implement to be a compatible DSA verifier.
INTERFACE Verifier
  /// Execute the verification of the signature against the message by using the encapsulated public key material.
  METHOD verify(message: []byte, signature: []byte): bool
```

## `Ed25519Generator`

```pseudocode!
/// Generates private key material for Ed25519.
CLASS Ed25519Generator
  /// Generate the private key material; return Jwk includes private key material.
  STATIC METHOD generate(): Jwk
```

## `Ed25519Signer`

```pseudocode!
/// Implementation of [`Signer`](#signer) for Ed25519.
CLASS Ed25519Signer IMPLEMENTS Signer
  CONSTRUCTOR(private_key: Jwk)

  /// Implementation of Signer's sign instance method for Ed25519.
  METHOD sign(payload: []byte): []byte
```

## `Ed25519Verifier`

```pseudocode!
/// Implementation of [`Verifier`](#verifier) for Ed25519.
CLASS Ed25519Verifier IMPLEMENTS Verifier
  CONSTRUCTOR(public_key: Jwk)

  /// Implementation of Verifier's dsa_verify instance method for Ed25519.
  METHOD verify(payload: []byte): bool
```

# Decentralized Identifier's (DIDs)

## `Did`

```pseudocode!
/// Representation of a [DID Core Identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#identifiers).
CLASS Did
  /// URI represents the complete Decentralized Identifier (DID) URI.
  /// Spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax.
  PUBLIC DATA uri: string

  /// URL represents the DID URI + A network location identifier for a specific resource.
  /// Spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-url-syntax.
  PUBLIC DATA url: string

  /// Method specifies the DID method in the URI, which indicates the underlying method-specific identifier scheme (e.g., jwk, dht, key, etc.).
  /// Spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#method-schemes.
  PUBLIC DATA method: string

  /// ID is the method-specific identifier in the DID URI.
  /// Spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#method-specific-id.
  PUBLIC DATA id: string

  /// Params is a map containing optional parameters present in the DID URI. These parameters are method-specific.
  /// Spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-parameters.
  PUBLIC DATA params: Map<string, string>?

  /// Path is an optional path component in the DID URI.
  /// Spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#path.
  PUBLIC DATA path: string?

  /// Query is an optional query component in the DID URI, used to express a request for a specific representation or resource related to the DID.
  /// Spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#query.
  PUBLIC DATA query: string?

  /// Fragment is an optional fragment component in the DID URI, used to reference a specific part of a DID document.
  /// Spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#fragment.
  PUBLIC DATA fragment: string?

  CONSTRUCTOR(uri: string)
```

  /// different times. The assertion that two or more DIDs (or other types of URI)
